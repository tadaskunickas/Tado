	                                                                     Determination and persistence are my strong suits. I’m very self-motivated so when I set my mind to something,
                                                                       nothing in my way can stop me. I also have a strong creative side which I like to express through various art forms;
                                                                       photography, sketching, cooking. This creative nature shows up in my professional work as well; engineering products,
                                                                       devising business solutions, consulting companies and individuals. Positivity is also a strong suit of mine. I am

																																			 I embrace the growth mindset. This means taking a step back from your ego, allowing yourself to be naïve at times,
																																			 accepting adversity and taking it on, setting goals and making efforts to achieve them, challenging yourself, testing
																																			 your limits, learning from adversity AND prosperity, thinking for yourself and thinking as your future self.
																																			 <br />
																																			 <br />
																																			 1. HEALTH IS WEALTH <br />
																																				 ○ Take care of your health NOW  <br />  <br />

																																			 2. APPRECIATE THE JOURNEY <br />
																																				 ○ Enjoy life NOW, this isn't a rehearsal <br /> <br />

																																			 3. EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN TIMELINE <br />
																																				 ○ Run your own race <br /> <br />

																																			 4. ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO LEARN IS STARTING TO LEARN <br />
																																				 ○ Start by reading 1 page <br />
																																				 ○ Start by doing 1 pushup <br />
																																				 ○ Start by witting 1 paragraph <br />
																																				 ○ Start TODAY <br /> <br />

																																			 5. GIVING IS A GIFT <br />
																																				 ○ YOU MAKE A LIVING BY WHAT YOU GET, BUT YOU MAKE A LIFE BY WHAT YOU GIVE <br /> <br />

																																			 6. FAILURE ISNT FATAL, AND SUCCESS ISNT FINAL <br />
																																				 ○ Fail often, fail early <br /> <br />

																																			 7. THE TRUE INNER SELF IS HAPPY WHEN YOU FOLLOW WHAT YOUR INNER SELF SAYS <br />
																																				 ○ Breaking habits, not being discipline = Short term happiness <br />
																																				 ○ Sticking to your morals, roots, good habits = Long term happiness  <br /> <br />

																																			 8. Fear STOPS us from being our best selves <br />
																																				 ○ Fear that we are not enough <br />
																																				 ○ Fear that we wont be loved  <br />
																																			EVERYTHING LEADS BACK TO THESE TWO FEARS <br /> <br />
