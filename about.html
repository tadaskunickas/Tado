																																			 	1. HEALTH IS WEALTH
																																			 		○ Take care of your health NOW

																																			 	2. APPRECIATE THE JOURNEY
																																			 		○ Enjoy life NOW, this isn't a rehearsal

																																			 	3. EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN TIMELINE
																																			 		○ Run your own race

																																			 		○ Start TODAY

																																			 	5. GIVING IS A GIFT
																																			 		○ YOU MAKE A LIVING BY WHAT YOU GET, BUT YOU MAKE A LIFE BY WHAT YOU GIVE

																																			 		○ Breaking habits, not being discipline = Short term happiness
																																			 		○ Sticking to your morals, roots, good habits = Long term happiness

																																			 	8. Fear STOPS us from being our best selves
																																			 		○ Fear that we are not enough
																																			 		○ Fear that we wont be loved
